## Scenario

A multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses recently experienced a DDoS attack. During the attack, the organizationâ€™s network services suddenly stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP packets. Normal internal network traffic could not access any network resources. 
I used the CSF to help navigation through the different steps of analyzing this cybersecurity event and integrate the analysis into a general security strategy. I have broken the analysis of the given case into different parts of the template below. You can explore them here:

## NIST CSF

+ **Identify** security risks through regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential gaps in security. 
+ **Protect** internal assets through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats. 
+ **Detect** potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections. 
+ **Respond** to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents; implement improvements to the security process. 
+ **Recover** affected systems to normal operation and restore systems data and/or assets that have been affected by an incident.
